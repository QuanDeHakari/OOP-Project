As first year student. This is project for my OOP course. Individually. It's about a boy, Strayer, gathering coin in gates. Whatever you choose, the first gate will always be normal one and the other will be corrupted.
At beginning i tended to make a turn base game but it turned out the battle logic had error and i had to change since deadline was approaching.
